LOGAL is a set of Lua OpenGL and OpenAL bindings. It is computer-generated from a Lua description of the function parameters. It can be roughly divided into LGL and LAL, with a common generator backend.

It is intended that LGL will eventually cover all current versions of OpenGL, and OpenGLES. Right now, it's limited to partial coverage of OpenGL 2.1.

LGL currently depends on GLee, though I plan to remove this dependency in future versions.

LAL targets OpenAL 1.1 exclusively. I'm currently only targeting OpenAL itself, not OpenALC or OpenALES.

LOGAL is not currently intended for production use, and needs a lot of shakedown before it is. Nevertheless, it's being actively used in my games at http://www.mandible.net, from July 2010 and on.
