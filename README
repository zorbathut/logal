LGL is a set of Lua OpenGL bindings. It is computer-generated from a Lua description of the OpenGL function parameters.

It is intended that this will eventually cover all current versions of OpenGL and OpenGLES. Right now, it's limited to partial coverage of OpenGL 2.1.

LGL currently depends on GLee, though I plan to remove this dependency in future versions.

LGL is not currently intended for production use, and needs a lot of shakedown before it is. Nevertheless, it's being actively used in my games at http://www.mandible.net, from July 2010 and on.
